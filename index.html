        <h1>Alone</h1>
        <span>by Edgar Alan Poe</span>
        <p>From childhood’s hour I have not been<br> 
            As others were—I have not seen<br> 
            As others saw—I could not bring <br>
            My passions from a common spring— <br>
            From the same source I have not taken<br> 
            My sorrow—I could not awaken<br>
            My heart to joy at the same tone—<br>
            And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—<br>
            Then—in my childhood—in the dawn<br> 
            Of a most stormy life—was drawn <br>
            From ev’ry depth of good and ill <br>
            The mystery which binds me still— <br>
            From the torrent, or the fountain— <br>
            From the red cliff of the mountain—<br> 
            From the sun that ’round me roll’d <br>
            In its autumn tint of gold— <br>
            From the lightning in the sky<br> 
            As it pass’d me flying by— <br>
            From the thunder, and the storm—<br> 
            And the cloud that took the form <br>
            (When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br> 
            Of a demon in my view—<br>
        </p>
